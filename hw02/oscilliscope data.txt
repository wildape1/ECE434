togglegpio.sh	(Shell commands)	
Min V	 						-0.03 V	
Max V	 						3.32 V	
Period							238ms	
How close to 200ms?				38ms	
Why do they differ?				The bash script is modifying the files to change the GPIO pins which adds a lot of overhead which takes more time
CPU Usage						15.80%	
How stable is period?			Fairly stable, small variation (~5%)
Vi period stability?			The period stability goes way down when vi is open
Changing bash to sh				The period decreases since sh is a lower level shell so there is less overhead
cleaning up togglegpio.sh		Cleaning up some of the lines significantly decreased the period
Shortest period	36ms

togglegpio.py	(Python)	
Min Voltage (V)					-0.03 V
Max Voltage (V)					3.32 V	
Period							201.4ms					
How close to 200ms?				1.4ms	
Why do they differ?				Python libraries have much less over-head but still a small amount
CPU Usage						2.70%	
How stable is period?			The period stability seems less than the stability from the .sh file
Vi period stability?			The period stability stays constant
Shortest period	385us

Max Voltage (V)					3.32	
Period							201.0ms	
How close to 200ms?				1.0ms	
Why do they differ?				C is a lower level langauge but still has some over-head
CPU Usage						2.60%	
How stable is period?			Fairly stable, small variation (~5%)
Vi period stability?			The period becomes much less stable
