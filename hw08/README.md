|2.6 Blinking an LED | The **start** target has a command to start the PRU code.  The **stop** target is run before start and will stop the PRU code from running.  With the delay set to zero it achieved a frequency of 42kHz |  |
|5.3 PWM Generator | Achieved a very stable 50MHz, very little jitter and symetrical | ![alt text](https://github.com/wildape1/ECE434/blob/master/hw08/tek00010.png) |
|5.4 Controlling PWM freq | Driving P9_28, P9_29, P9_30 and P9_31.  There is jitter in all the signals | ![alt text](https://github.com/wildape1/ECE434/blob/master/hw08/tek00009.png) |
|5.9 Reading input at regular intervals | Using the cursors I measured a delay of 53.6ns | ![alt text](https://github.com/wildape1/ECE434/blob/master/hw08/tek00005.png) |

2.6: 42kHz seems too slow.  What delay were you using?
