|2.6 Blinking an LED | The **start** target has a command to start the PRU code.  The **stop** target is run before start and will stop the PRU code from running.  With the delay set to zero it achieved a frequency of 42kHz | ![alt text](https://github.com/wildape1/ECE434/blob/master/hw08/tek00010.png) |
|5.3 PWM Generator | Achieved a very stable 50MHz, very little jitter and symetrical |  |
|5.4 Controlling PWM freq | Driving P9_28, P9_29, P9_30 and P9_31.  There is jitter in all the signals |  |
|5.9 Reading input at regular intervals | using the cursors i measured a delay of 53.6ns |  |
