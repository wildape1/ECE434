WELCOME TO ETCH-A-SKETCH!!!

Use the rotary encoders on either side of the 8*8 matrix to move the cursor across the display

The left encoder controls the vertical movement
The right encoder controls the horizontal movement
Use the push button built into the rotary encoder to clear the screen

Run the program by simply running ./etchasketch
