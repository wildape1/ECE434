# Homework 6

## Project

Lee and I created our wiki page for our project.  We have not had time to make any progress on the project itself so there was nothing to add to the page yet.  It will get updated as we start to make progress this week

## Blynk

The example code given "leds.js" was modified to also control the brightness of an led using a slider.  The program can now control the USR3 Led via the app as well as control a virtual LED on the app from a physical button, as well as control the brightness of an LED via a slider.
The function is run using: 

    ./leds.js 
    
The blynk librarys can be installed using 

    sudo npm install -g -unsafe-perm blynk-library
